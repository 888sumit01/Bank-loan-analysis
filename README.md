Bank Loan Analysis
This project presents an in-depth analysis of bank loan data using Power BI, focusing on loan application trends, funding performance, and borrower characteristics. 
It includes three interactive dashboards that provide high-level KPIs, visual insights, and borrower-level data, enabling better decision-making for loan performance monitoring and risk assessment.

📊 Dashboards Overview
📁 Dashboard 1: KPIs & Loan Status Summary
This dashboard gives a high-level snapshot of loan operations with essential metrics and status tracking.
Key Metrics (KPIs):
✅ Total Loan Applications
💰 Total Funded Amount
📥 Total Amount Received
📊 Average Interest Rate
📈 Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio

Time-based Performance:
•	Month-over-Month (MoM) trends
•	Month-to-Date (MTD) performance (using DAX measures)

Loan Quality Segmentation: Good vs Bad Loan breakdown:
•	Applications count
•	Funded amount
•	Amount received
Loan Status Table: Analyses current, fully paid, charged-off, and other loan statuses to assess operational performance.

🌐 Dashboard 2: Loan Overview
This dashboard explores how loan metrics vary across categories and time.
Key metrics (Total Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received) are broken down for detailed pattern analysis.
